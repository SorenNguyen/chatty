 * These exist because the two suites below them cannot see the thing this app
 * is actually for. A service test proves what `sendMessage` asks the socket
 * layer to broadcast; a component test proves what `MessageList` renders given
 * an array. Neither can answer "does a message typed by one person appear on
 * another person's screen", which is the entire product — and which has broken
 * twice in this project's history in ways every green test missed.
 *
 * Until now that gap was covered by scripts written, run, and deleted by hand.

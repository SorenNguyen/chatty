 * bounding how long a stale verdict can survive.
 *
 * Both directions of staleness are uneventful. A block prunes the socket's rooms
 * synchronously, so the hash lookup below already refuses before this is
 * consulted; an unblock can leave a cached refusal in place for a few seconds,
 * which costs an indicator that expires on its own anyway.

 * the database when the socket connects, extended when a conversation is created
 * for them, and pruned when a block commits. Consulting it is a hash lookup,
 * where a query would be a round trip several times a sentence to announce
 * something that expires in seconds.
 *
 * The check is not optional, though. `socket.to(room)` addresses any room by
 * name, joined or not, so without it anyone could type into a stranger's chat.
 *
 * Behind it sits one database check of the block policy, because a room is
 * delivery bookkeeping rather than authorization and can be briefly stale — a
 * block committing between reconciliation and this keystroke, or a client that
 * kept an old membership across a reconnect. It is cached per conversation for
 * `POLICY_VERDICT_TTL_MS` so that the ordinary keystroke stays a hash lookup,
 * which is what the paragraph above promises.

/**
 * Restricting, and the two things it changes.
 *
 * A block refuses the write. A restriction refuses **nothing** — the message is
 * written, delivered and readable, in the same conversation it always was — and
 * instead changes what it reveals: it stops counting towards the restrictor's
 * unread badge (see `countUnreadByConversation` in `conversations.service.ts`),
 * and this person stops seeing the restrictor's read receipts
 * (`markConversationRead`) and presence (`sockets/presence.ts`).
 *
 * A dedicated "Message requests" mailbox — moving the conversation itself
 * somewhere else, the way Instagram/Messenger do — is deliberately not part of
 * this: it needs its own schema state and its own inbox view, not just a filter
 * on data that already exists. Left as a follow-up, not implied by anything here.
 *
 * The row is directed and, unlike a block, so is every effect. That asymmetry is
 * the feature: a block is a wall between two people, while a restriction is
 * something one person does to their own inbox. Restricting somebody does not
 * take away *your* view of them, which is why you can still read the thread and
 * still see when they are online.
 *
 * Nobody is told. That is the whole difference from blocking as far as the other
 * person can observe, and it is why none of the enforcement below may ever
 * produce an error a sender could tell apart from an ordinary success.

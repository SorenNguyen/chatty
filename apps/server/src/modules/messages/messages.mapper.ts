/**
 * How a message row becomes a `MessageDTO`, and which columns that needs.
 *
 * A fifth file in a module the conventions describe as four, for one reason:
 * `conversations.service` selects a `lastMessage` and has to produce the same
 * shape, and it cannot import this from `messages.service` because
 * `messages.service` already imports `assertParticipant` from
 * `conversations.service`. That cycle is not merely untidy — `conversationSelect`
 * is a module-level const built from `messageSelect`, so whichever of the two
 * loaded second would read it during the other's temporal dead zone and crash
 * on a startup ordering nobody chose.
 *
 * Splitting the mapper out breaks the cycle instead of hiding it: this file
 * imports neither service, so both can import it.
 *
 * Keeping one copy matters beyond the cycle. Two column lists for one DTO is how
 * a field ends up rendered on a message in the chat and missing on the very same
 * message in the sidebar.

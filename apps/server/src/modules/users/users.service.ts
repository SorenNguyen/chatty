/**
 * Deletes the signed-in user's account, for good.

 * their password reset tokens and their pending email changes. Their avatar file
 * goes too, which closes the "avatar files are not cleaned up" gap: nothing used
 * to delete a user, so nothing had ever been the right place to delete the file.
 *
 * **What stays, and why it is not an oversight:** their messages. The rows are
 * kept with `authorId` set to null — the foreign key is `ON DELETE SET NULL`
 * specifically so this cannot cascade — because deleting them would empty other
 * people's conversations of half a discussion, and because hard-deleting message
 * rows breaks read markers and paging cursors for everyone else in the thread.
 * That is the same argument phase 8 made for tombstoning a deleted message, and
 * it does not get weaker when the account rather than the message is what went.
 *
 * The name goes with the account. The client renders an authorless USER message
 * as "Deleted account", rather than keeping a snapshot of who wrote it: holding
 * on to the name of somebody who just asked to be erased is the opposite of what
 * they asked for. It is a decision rather than a default — the alternative, an
 * author name copied onto the message at write time, is a real design that other
 * apps choose — and this is where it is recorded.
 *
 * Attachments on those messages stay for the same reason the text does. Account
 * deletion therefore does **not** close the orphaned-attachment gap; that one is
 * about files whose upload failed, and it needs a sweep of the upload directory.
 *
 * Every group they were in learns about it, gets a new owner if it needs one, and
 * says so in its log — see `removeUserFromEveryGroup`. One transaction, so a
 * crash cannot leave somebody half-departed.

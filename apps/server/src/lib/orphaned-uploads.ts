/**
 * Deleting the attachment files nothing points at any more.
 *
 * The gap this closes is the *send* path, not the delete one. Deleting a message
 * already removes its file (phase 8), and account deletion deliberately does not
 * — the messages survive, so their attachments are still referenced. What is left
 * is narrower and unfixable at the call site: `sendMessage` writes the file
 * before it writes the row, on purpose, because the other order leaves a message
 * pointing at a picture that is not there. A request that dies in that window
 * leaves a file nothing will ever reference, and no amount of care inside the
 * service can see it afterwards.
 *
 * So it is swept, the way the outbox's settled rows are: a slow timer, a bounded
 * query, and a rule about age that makes the dangerous case impossible rather
 * than unlikely.
 *
 * This is bytes rather than correctness. A file nobody references is invisible to
 * every screen in the app; it is only ever a disk filling up quietly on a machine
 * nobody is watching.
 */

/**
 * How long a file must have been on disk before it is a candidate.
 *
 * This is the whole safety argument, and it has to be generous rather than
 * tight. A file written seconds ago may belong to a request that has not
 * committed its row yet — the window `sendMessage` opens on purpose — and
 * deleting *that* file turns a working upload into a broken image, which is
 * strictly worse than the wasted bytes this is here to reclaim. An hour is far
 * past any request that is still alive, and the cost of waiting is a few
 * kilobytes for an hour.

 * Safe to run on every instance. Two sweeps racing compute the same set and both
 * call `rm --force`, which is what makes deleting the same file twice a no-op
 * rather than an error. There is deliberately no lock: a lock would be a second
 * thing to get right for an operation that is already idempotent.
 *
 * The database is asked only about the files that are old enough to be
 * candidates, so a deployment with a large upload directory and nothing wrong
 * with it asks about nothing at all.

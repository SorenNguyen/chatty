/**
 * Outbound email: the contract, and the two transports behind it.
 *
 * The interface has always been the point — `auth.service.ts` knows nothing
 * about how a message leaves the building, and `outbox.ts` owns whether it
 * eventually does. What changed in phase 10 is that one of the implementations
 * now actually sends.
 *
 * SMTP rather than a provider's HTTP API, and that is a deliberate narrowing:
 * every provider worth using speaks it (Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, SES, a
 * company relay), so the choice of provider becomes a connection string rather
 * than a dependency and a client to maintain. The cost is no provider-specific
 * features — templates, webhooks, per-message analytics — none of which this
 * app has any use for.
 *
 * The console transport stays, and is not a mock: it is what development uses,
 * printing the link so the flow can be walked without an inbox. What it no
 * longer is, is reachable by accident — see `MAIL_TRANSPORT` in config/env.ts.

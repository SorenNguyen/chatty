/**

 *
 * **The claim comes first, and it is not politeness.** `tests/setup.ts`
 * truncates every table before every test, so a second run — another terminal, a
 * watch mode left open, a CI job and a developer at the same moment — deletes
 * the first run's fixtures mid-test. It does not surface as anything resembling
 * a collision: it is "user does not exist" and "email already registered"
 * scattered across files that have nothing to do with each other, which reads as
 * a broken suite rather than a busy database. That cost real time before this
 * existed, and it is the first thing an outside contributor would hit.
 *
 * A session-scoped advisory lock rather than a row or a file, because it is
 * released when the connection ends — including when this process is killed with
 * `ctrl-c` or dies. A lock that has to be cleaned up is a lock that eventually
 * strands the database in "busy" with nobody holding it.
 *
 * DATABASE_URL is passed to the migration explicitly rather than inherited.
 * globalSetup runs outside the test environment, so vitest's `test.env` does not
 * reach it — and without this, the Prisma CLI falls back to .env and migrates
 * the DEV database.
 *
 * `migrate deploy` (not `migrate dev`) only applies existing migrations and
 * never prompts or generates new ones, which is what a non-interactive run needs.

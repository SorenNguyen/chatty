 * of its author's previous messages, sit under the right day rule, and be laid
 * out by the cluster grammar without a second code path.
 *
 * `attachments` are local ones built by `toDraftAttachments`: real dimensions
 * and a `blob:` URL, so the gallery reserves the exact box the stored picture
 * will occupy and nothing shifts when the server's version replaces it.
 *
 * The fields that are null are null because they are facts the server owns and
 * has not yet stated: nothing may be edited, deleted or reacted to before it
 * exists, and `authorActionExpiresAt` counts from a `createdAt` the database
 * has not written yet. `createdAt` is the local clock purely so the message
 * sorts last and under today's rule; it is replaced by the server's within the
 * round trip.

 * Saves an attachment to the reader's machine.
 *
 * **The obvious version does not work here.** `<a download>` is honoured only
 * for a same-origin href, and the API is a different origin from the web app in
 * every environment this project has — so the anchor would navigate to the
 * picture instead of saving it, replacing the conversation with a full-screen
 * image and no way back but the back button.
 *
 * Fetching the bytes and pointing the anchor at a `blob:` URL of our own origin
 * is what puts the attribute back in force. The fetch itself is allowed because
 * the attachment URL carries its own signed token — see `AttachmentDTO.url` —
 * and the API sends CORS headers for the web app's origin.

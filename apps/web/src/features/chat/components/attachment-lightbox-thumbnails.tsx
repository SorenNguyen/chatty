/**
 * The rest of the set, under the picture.
 *
 * **Centred, and not with `justify-center`.** A centred flex row that overflows
 * its scroller loses its first items off the left edge with no way to scroll
 * back to them — and a set large enough to overflow is exactly when the strip
 * earns its place. An inner `w-max` row centred by `mx-auto` sits in the middle
 * while it fits and scrolls from its true start once it does not.
 *
 * The one that is open is stated by opacity and a ring rather than by a border:
 * a border on the active thumbnail and none on the others changes each tile's
 * size as the reader moves through the set.

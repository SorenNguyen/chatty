/**
 * The "find someone by name, handle or email" state machine.
 *
 * Extracted because it is about to have a second, near-identical caller
 * (adding a member to an existing group, alongside starting a new
 * conversation) — searching is a fetch-loading-error state machine either
 * way, and the two screens would otherwise carry the exact same four
 * `useState` calls. What differs between them — multi-select-then-confirm
 * versus click-to-add-immediately — is the interaction, not the search
 * itself, so only that part stays in each component.
 *
 * `excludeUserIds` filters results client-side rather than being sent to the
 * server: it is "people already in this specific group", a fact this screen
 * knows and the search endpoint has no reason to.

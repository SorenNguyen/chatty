/**
 * Where the "new messages" rule goes, and what it says.
 *
 * The whole difficulty is that `unreadCount` drops to zero within a second of
 * opening a conversation — `useMarkRead` sees to that — so a divider positioned
 * from the live value would appear and immediately vanish, taking the reader's
 * only marker for where they left off with it. The count is captured once per
 * conversation in a ref, and the position is captured once from it.
 *
 * The `conversationId` guard on the second effect is not redundant with the
 * first. Switching conversations resets the ref, but `messages` still holds the
 * *previous* conversation's array for the render before its first page arrives —
 * long enough to place a divider in the wrong thread, which then never moves,
 * because `unreadDividerMessageId` being set is what stops it being recomputed.

 * from timing the user out but far less than a person types; and a stop is sent
 * after TYPING_IDLE_MS of silence, so pausing to think clears the indicator
 * without the sender doing anything.
 *
 * All the bookkeeping sits in refs rather than state: none of it is rendered,
 * and holding it in state would re-render the input on every keystroke to no
 * visible effect.

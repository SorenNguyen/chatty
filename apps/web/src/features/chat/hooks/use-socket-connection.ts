 * Whether the socket is currently down, and a callback for when it comes back.
 *
 * Both halves exist because a dropped socket is silent. Nothing in this app
 * polls, so between the drop and the reconnect the screen keeps rendering the
 * last thing it heard — a sidebar and a thread that are quietly out of date with
 * no sign that anything is missing.
 *
 * `onReconnect` fires only on a *re*connection, never on the first one: the
 * initial connect happens alongside the fetches that populate the screen, and
 * resyncing then would repeat them.
 *
 * The returned flag is delayed by `CONNECTION_WARNING_DELAY_MS` rather than
 * following `socket.connected` exactly — see that constant.

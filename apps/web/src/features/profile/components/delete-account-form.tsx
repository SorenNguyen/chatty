/**
 * Deletes the account, behind a password and a confirmation step.
 *
 * Two steps rather than one button, because this is the only action in the app
 * that nothing can undo: the first press reveals what is about to happen and asks
 * for the password, and only the second sends anything. A single red button next
 * to "Change password" is one mis-click from an account that does not exist.
 *
 * No redirect on success and no navigation of its own — clearing the session in
 * the store is enough. The route guard in app.tsx sends an unauthenticated
 * visitor to /login, which is the same path a sign-out takes.

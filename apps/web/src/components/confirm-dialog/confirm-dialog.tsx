 * Asks before something that cannot be taken back.

 * The app went without one for a long time on the stated grounds that nothing
 * else had one, which was true and was the wrong test: the reason to confirm is
 * that the action is irreversible, and removing somebody from a group, leaving
 * one, and deleting a message for everybody all are. What kept it out was the
 * absence of a dialog primitive; `use-dialog` is that primitive, and it already
 * carries Escape, the focus trap and focus-on-open.
 *
 * The confirm button is `danger`, which is outlined rather than filled for the
 * reason recorded in `Button`: a solid red block invites the click this dialog
 * exists to slow down. Cancel is the first control in the DOM, so the focus
 * trap's opening move is the harmless one.
